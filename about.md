## About Me

Born and raised during a time of unprecedented technological growth, I developed a natural enthusiasm for understanding the intricate science behind computers and their profound impact on our lives. My fascination with machines and their role in shaping human progress led me to delve into electronics and communication, where I found joy in learning the fundamentals of electronic systems and computer programming.

### My Professional Journey

Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of building software for an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a digital product studio.

At **Seagate Technologies**, I led an 8-person global team, enhancing RAID product quality by developing and expanding a test automation framework. This initiative resulted in a 37% reduction in test time and improved resource allocation efficiency by 15%.

Currently, as a **Cloud Engineer Intern** at the **North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies**, I channel my passion into optimizing cloud solutions and accelerating climate science research. I developed and optimized ETL pipelines using AWS services, significantly reducing data processing time by 60% and automating data pipelines with Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
